*🛒 neoCommerce Platform*
---

This project is a full-featured e-commerce application built to demonstrate modern software engineering practices. It incorporates MVC architecture, a scalable relational database, modular service design, and integration with a third-party payment processor (Stripe).

Key functionalities include user authentication, product catalog management, shopping cart operations, order processing, and secure payments.

Features

- Secure handling of user data

🛍 Product Catalog
- Manage products with categories and inventory tracking
- Product image support

🛒 Cart & Checkout
- Add, update, or remove items
- View detailed pricing and cart total

📦 Order Processing
- Place orders and view order summaries
- Seamless Stripe integration for transactions

💳 Payment
- Stripe checkout integration
- Handles both success and failure cases gracefully

🗄 Database
- Normalized relational design with indexing and foreign keys
- Structured for scalability and efficient queries

⚠ Error Handling
- Custom exception classes for clearer errors
- Robust handling of edge cases and failures

Technologies
---

1. Backend
- Java
- Spring Boot (Controllers, Services, Repositories)

2. Database
- MySQL with relational design
- Foreign keys + indexes for performance

3. Payments
- Stripe API

4. Tools
- Lombok (reduces boilerplate)

Highlights
---
💳 Stripe Integration: Secure payments through Stripe’s checkout API

🚀 Optimized Schema: Designed for efficient growth

⚠ Robust Error Management: Custom exceptions improve clarity and handling

⚡ Performance: Caching and indexes used to boost speed


Limitations
---
- Stripe fees may not suit very small operations

- High-scale traffic would need additional DB strategies (e.g., sharding)

- Caching layers need strong invalidation logic

- Monitoring tools like ELK, Sentry could be added for production


Future Improvements
---
- Introduce Kafka (or similar) for async processing

- Add support for multiple payment providers

- Build a modern frontend (React/Angular)

- Integrate advanced monitoring (e.g., New Relic, Datadog)
